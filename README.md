## Git & GitHub Practice Repository

This repository is created to **practice and understand Git and GitHub fundamentals** using the Ubuntu Linux terminal.

### What this repo covers

* Initializing a Git repository locally
* Making commits and understanding tracked vs untracked files
* Creating a GitHub repository directly from CLI using `gh`
* Connecting local repo to GitHub
* Branch creation and pushing branches to GitHub
* Understanding how branches relate to `main` (GitHub Flow basics)

### Key learnings

* A new branch starts with everything from `main`
* Changes appear only after new commits
* `git commit -am` does not add new files
* Repositories can be fully managed from the terminal without GitHub UI

### Tools used

* Git
* GitHub CLI (`gh`)
* Ubuntu Linux (Terminal)

This repo is purely for **learning, experimenting, and building confidence with real Git workflows**.
